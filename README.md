Input-to-Action Binding Application for Windows

Application I wrote in 2010 to bind keyboard, joystick, and whatever else to actions using Microsoft .NET Framework.

This application is made public for research and development purposes.  No guarantee it still works.  I last tested it on Windows 7 SP1 with success.

All non-GitHub projects that I referenced (at the time) are included in the Dependencies folder.
